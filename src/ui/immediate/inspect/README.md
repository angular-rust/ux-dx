Default traits and implementations for inspecting values with UX-DX immediate mode UI

This is an adaptation of the project https://github.com/aclysma/imgui-inspect.

I think this module only needs to be included in the debug profile. 
So figure out the `cfg` annotation in your code yourself. 
At the moment, it is available in any profile mode. 

Huge respect to the guys from the project https://github.com/aclysma/imgui-inspect
